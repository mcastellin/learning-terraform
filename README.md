I want to test out Terraform capabilities by implementing a cloudformation build with it

TODO: 
- [ ] draft some idea for a pipeline to build with Terraform
- [ ] register for another Cloud account other than AWS to test out multi cloud
- [ ] I also want to try build a bot that acts upon PR changes and comment back or move statuses or merge
